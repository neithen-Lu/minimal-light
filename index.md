## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Guodong Li](https://gdli-stat.github.io/). My research interest is high-dimenisonal statistics (especially time series data), tensor techniques and deep learning methodology. Recently I am also exploring generative models for sequential data. I received my B.Sc. degree from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) with first class honours.

## Misc.
I consider reading as a life-long hobby and am especially indulged in Sci-Fic and classical literature. Also love collecting cute gadgets like postcards, ornaments, mugs, dolls, etc.
